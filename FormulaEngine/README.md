The Formula Engine allows applications to dynamically define complex formulas and execute those formulas using application data at scale and with high performance.  Business applications which require evaluation of dynamic and complex mathematical expressions are often found in many financial, engineering and analytical business processes. The Formula Engine provides such business applications a means to abstract business specific formulas out of source code and manage them outside the application.
